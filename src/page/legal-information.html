          Driven by more than 100 years of innovation, we collaborate with
          customers around the world across a wide range of industries. For
          decades, our innovations have improved the quality of life for
          consumers. Our materials go into everything from can coatings for the
          food you eat to the fibers in your clothing and home textiles. Our
          resins make housewares dishwasher safe, tough, and stylish and
          high-performance medical devices more durable. We provide organic
          acids that replace antibiotics in animal feed. And our polymers are in
          low-emissions coatings for homes and cars.

          We’re ushering in a new era of innovation while helping our partners
          solve society’s greatest sustainability challenges. Our innovative
          films enable electric vehicles to be lighter weight for greater range
          and are used for next-generation technology like head-up displays for
          windshields to improve safety. We’re also a world leader at developing
          fiber from sustainably sourced wood pulp to make sustainable clothing,
          biobased plastic for eyewear, and compostable food packaging that
          won’t harm the planet.
